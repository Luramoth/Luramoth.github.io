			<h2>About Who?</h2>

			<p>
				Well, you'd think its me but really its more then that, ill explain:
			</p>
			<h3>What is Luramoth?</h3>
			<p>
				Luramoth is multiple things, you may know it as a game studio, you may know it as a software studio, but you want to hear from the 
				source, what is Luramoth?
			</p>
			<h3>Seriously, what is Luramoth?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A accessability movement</li>
				My personal belief is that everyone should have access to everything 
				regardless to who or what they are. Not just in the sense for people with 
				disability(thought we do try to accommodate in any way possible to them) 
				but also users of any platform, be it Windows, Mac (apple silicon or not), Linux, 
				Android, and Ios.
				<li>A push for innovation where its needed</li>
				You ever have the moment where you ask yourself, "why hasn't someone made {thing} yet?" 
				Luramoth asks the same thing and tries to push to take action. We are askers who 
				take action. Why hasn't someone made {thing} yet? Because Luramoth hasn't gotten their
				hands on it yet.
				<li>An outlet of creativity</li>
				The brain is beautiful, a complicated machine thats impossible to understand the fact 
				that, in a technical sense, just a bunch of frayed wires is able to make ideas 
				that quite literally exist nowhere else is nothing short of incredible. Being 
				able to express that is of the upmost importance to me on a personal level and Luramoth 
				as a whole.
				<li>You</li>
				if you identify with the above statements then that means you as a person are part of Luramoth. 
				Luramoth isn't an individual rather a conglomerate of people with the same ideology, 
				mind you preferably in a way thats not occult.(Sorry no sacrificing lambs for the mighty 
				moth, they were innocent anyways)
			</ul>
			<h3>But like, aren't you like, primarily a game development company?</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Short answer: yes.</b>
