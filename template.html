			<h2>Huh?!</h2>

			<p>
				Huh? how did we get here?, this is the HTML file I use as a template for all of my other pages.
				 Well wether this was an error (<a href="index.html">In which case you should click here to go back to the home page </a>and 
				 <a href="https://github.com/Luramoth/Luramoth.github.io/issues/new" target="_blank">submit an issue to this page's github</a>) 
				 or if you are here just because you got curious, I welcome you here and ill tell you a bonus fact: wether you do or don't know 
				 im a Linux user, and its widely understood that there are more hardcore Linux distributions out there like 
				 <a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> and <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/" target="_blank">Gentoo Linux </a>
				I used to use Arch Linux myself until I had a drive partition error that I knew was there but I had no clue how to fix
				I personally find it to be a waste of time to try to install Arch, its fun once when you get that initial learning experience
				but after that its frankly a waste of time and I don't personally trust the <a href="no.html" target="_blank">Arch Linux GUI </a> team 
				so ive decided to go with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS</a> as my daily driver and its been going super swell
			</p>

			<h2>Why Pop!_OS over Arch?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>As far as I know, System76 is'nt a shady company!</li>
				Though they have been having a small bit of beef with the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank">GNOME</a> developers, 
				but at this point who hasn't?

				<br>
				<br>

				<li>They use GNOME, but with a spin!</li>
				They are trying to move more away from GNOME but as of late only really getting rid of the annoying parts
				I find GNOME to be a quite fun DE(Desktop Environment) and its  auto workspace feature just makes things so stupid simple
				for someone like me who does a lot of creative work as well as development. What System76 is doing is adding in a bunch of in-house developed
				extensions that add in some frankly welcome features (im sorry Stallman, but the minimize button is not bloat)

				<br>
				<br>

				<li>It's based on <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian!</a></li>
				Debian is stable, like super stable! and I love that over arch because, yes, you <i>can </i> make arch stable, even more so then Debian
				but that comes at the cost of even more wasted time <i>which I don't like! </i> id rather just have something done right out of the box

				<br>
				<br>

				<li>It's based on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> but makes it better!</li>
				Ubuntu is a really good operating system and I have a lot of respect to it, <i>but oh my god does it shove so many snaps down my throat </i>
				look i get it, they can be useful <i>at times </i>not all the time, please just let me install things normally
				<br>
				<br>
				Pop!_OS at least gives me an option between .deb packages and flatpak packages in a frankly nicer software installer (that actually still has a fun
				name, please GNOME, bring back the name nautilus it sounds so cool) but it still maintains all the super useful features and bits of
				device support and PPA's, not to mention my favorite phrase when it comes to Linux, "if it runs on linux, it runs on Ubuntu"
				because everyone tests specifically on Ubuntu because its the one that most people even use or hear about even

				<br>
				<br>

				<li>The theming and graphical design is not atrocious!</li>
				Speaking of Ubuntu, y'all remember the Hairy balls wallpaper? christ they actually put that on a little handbag thing as merch and it was hideously
				disgusting

				<br>
				<br>

				The nice teal blue with a complimentary pleasing orange and a whole bunch of stylized dithering, you can tell they got someone who knows what They 
				are doing
